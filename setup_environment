# OpenCL environment
# Set OPENCLSUPPORT to 1 to enable OpenCL integration in libopenacc. Also

#  on AMD platform: /opt/rocm-3.3.0/opencl/lib/x86_64/
# OPENCLINC is the path to the directory containing CL/cl.h
#  examples:
#  on NVIDIA platform: /usr/local/cuda/include/
#  on Intel platform: /opt/intel/opencl/include/
#  on AMD platform: /opt/rocm-3.3.0/opencl/include/
